---(Hello)

# Hello! I'm Miguel Mejía

// Now this font have accents :)

I've been a web developer for over 2 years and a visual communicator and photographer for almost 15. 

I enjoy creating digital and communicational tools that democratize access to information, encourage critical thinking and build narratives that promote more inclusive societies.

(This microsite focuses on my work as a developer).

## As a front-end web developer...

// Although I haven’t been programming for long, I am curious and enjoy the processes of learning and integrating knowledge.

### My Profile

I design and develop accessible and functional solutions that put people first. From the beginning of each project, I integrate principles and patterns that consider the bodily, sensory, cognitive, cultural and socioeconomic diversity of the users.

Working with algorithms and data structures as well researching, planning and developing tools fills me with energy, especially when I find sustainable and unexpected solutions to problems that seem to have no way out.

While I enjoy and understand the importance of test-driven development (TDD), I prefer to explore question-driven development (QDD), which keeps me curious and allows me to move forward with flexibility, especially on projects that are still in exploratory stages.

## ...as a visual communicator

### Image

I love semiotics and working with images as historical documents, this has enabled me to develop a critical and thoughtful view, which helps me to address in depth issues such as culture, functional and cognitive diversity, human rights, education, climate change and armed conflict.

### Information

I have worked from researching and structuring information to creating narratives and visual strategies to communicate ideas effectively. In addition, I enjoy sharing what I have learned through workshops, classes and labs focused on visual communication, ethics and technology.

Although images and information are constant in my work, the way I approach them changes over time. Currently my interest lays in creating digital tools that facilitate access to information.
