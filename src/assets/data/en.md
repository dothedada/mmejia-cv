---(Hello)

# Hello! I'm Miguel Mejia

// no accent due to the font

I've been working as a front-end web developer for 2 years and I have over 15 years as a visual communicator focused on photography and information architecture.

I like to create tools that facilitate the access to information and bring to life narratives that inspire and support the construction of more inclusive societies.

(This microsite is a glimpse into the work I do as a developer.)

## As a front-end web developer...

// Although I haven’t been programming for long, I am curious and enjoy the processes of learning and integrating knowledge.

### My Profile

I design and develop accessible and functional solutions that put users first. From the beginning of each project, I integrate principles and patterns that consider the body, sensory, cognitive, cultural and socioeconomic diversity of its users.

I enjoy working with algorithms and data structures (I am happy to create and implement Heaps). Researching, planning and developing tools fills me with energy, especially when I find sustainable and unexpected solutions to problems that seem to have no way out.

Although I enjoy and understand the importance of Test Driven Development (TDD), I prefer to explore Question Driven Development (QDD). This approach keeps my curiosity happy and allows me to move forward with flexibility, especially on projects that are still in exploration or definition stages.

### Technologies I work with:

-   CSS (including SCSS and SASS)
-   HTML (Semantic, md)
-   Lua
-   Bash (Basic)

## ...as a visual communicator

### Image

My fascination with semiotics and the image as a historical document has led me to develop a critical and reflective perspective. This allows me to address complex social issues such as disability, human rights, education, climate change, and armed conflict with respect and depth.

### Information

I have worked on tasks ranging from research and structuring information to creating narratives and visual strategies for effective communication. Additionally, I enjoy sharing what I’ve learned through workshops, classes, and labs focused on visual communication, ethics, and technology.

While image and information are the foundations of my work, how I approach them evolves over time. Today, I focus on creating digital tools that facilitate access to information. However, if you’re interested in exploring my work as a visual communicator and photographer, here are some links to those projects.
