I arrived at front-end development after more than thirteen years as a visual communicator and photographer, with the purpose of contributing to building more inclusive societies through communication and technology, leveraging my knowledge in research, narrative creation, and imagery.

At the end of last year, I decided to dedicate a year to boost my transition into front-end development. I reduced my workload to focus on studying and improving my programming skills.

During this time, I expanded my knowledge of JavaScript, data structures, UI/UX design principles, accessibility, HTML/CSS, and work environments with Git and Vite, achieving a high intermediate level. I also advanced in React.js (including React Router and PropTypes), TypeScript, algorithms, design patterns, and TDD (Vitest, Jest, and React Testing Library), reaching an intermediate level in these areas, and began learning Node.js while maintaining basic skills in AWS, Bash, and Lua. In the near future, I plan to study Go, as well as libraries like P5 and D3.

Thanks to this effort, I am now capable of seamlessly integrating the programming knowledge I have acquired with my expertise in communication and design, contributing to the development of accessible, useful, and memorable apps and websites.

I enjoy collaborative and interdisciplinary environments where roles are dynamic and prioritize collective well-being over individual talent, fostering knowledge exchange among all people and work areas.
